# This is a Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis simulator STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
## Created for Professor Marina Leite's lab work on solarcell augmentation
Intended to match up with the Fresnel equations on the special case of homogeneous optical media. `cell-power-issue' is the main branch, but `alt-omega' is the current branch under development.
Single and 0-harmonic setups match with Fresnel equations on `cell-power-issue'. We believe the issue is sign conventions.
# AGAIN, THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
