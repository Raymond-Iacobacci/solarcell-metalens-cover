# Unit tests
# Bad emission from torcwa
# Useless points (torcwa)
# Numerical instability at 
# Add intelligent model (PINN!)
# Base unit for all calculations (microns)
# Update RHSP to extended RHSP
# Add y-grating period and x-grating period
# Replace all relevant multiplications with manual multiplications with thresholding
# Make np.solve stable
